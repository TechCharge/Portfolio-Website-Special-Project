# Portfolio-Website-Special-Project

This website is intended to both showcase my work as a web developer and as a member of the field of computer science, as well as to further develop my skills as a web developer so as to better prepare me for the post-college experience.

Note: This is a school special project and as such, I've not had large amounts of time to work on this which is the reason behind the small number of commits.  However, I have been helping develop other pieces of software for a different project, but those changes have been submitted under a different account.
